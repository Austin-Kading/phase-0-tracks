- When elevator doors open, go in and look at number pad.
  - If lounge = 0
	elevator stays put
  - Else if any # > 0
	elevator goes up to that number floor
  - Else any # < 0
	elevator goes down



2.  Push up’s
	# of pushups = 0

 Until number of push up’s gets to 5

push up 1 + push up = 1
push up 2 + push up = 2
push up 3 + push up = 3
push up 4 + push up = 4
push up 5 + push up = 5

push up’s: lay down belly first and keep elbows straight. Descend chest almost down to the floor then back up to straight elbow length.
