# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the task of keeping a program with many versions well organized. This is useful because organization is key to programming and finding things properly.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separate place other than your master project to make edits and preparation to your final project at the end. When you feel like the branch is ready to bring back to the master project, you can then merge that branch back to your master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message will give a short and precise explanation to what changes have been made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when two branches are merged together with the same 2 copies of changes
