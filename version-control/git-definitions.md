# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the history of revisions to one or more files and merge changes made by multiple people.  It also allow us to roll back in time to any previous version.  Rolling back to a previous version is useful if a revision has unintended consequences.  Managing this manually on a large project would be a nightmare!

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Creating a branch gives us a copy of our project and allows us to work on a particular feature without making changes to the master.  Branching allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without tripping over each other and makes it easy to discard individual changes or features.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a save point, or a point we can roll back to.  A good commit message provides a detailed explanation of what has changed since the last commit.  For example, "add date of birth to client info form" rather than "update client info form".

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two or more branchs modify the same line in a file and the revisions conflict with each other.
